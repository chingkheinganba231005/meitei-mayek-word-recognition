# Phase 0: literature and data audit

Started 24 September 2026. Status: literature search and corpus licence audit done (first
pass); the IIIT Hyderabad question is settled (section 2); the first Colab run of the data audit
is done (section 10), and a second run with more detail is pending (section 11).

**How this was done, and what that means for citing.** The search ran in a cloud session whose
network allowed a web search engine and GitHub, but not publisher sites, arXiv, Hugging Face,
IIIT Hyderabad or the Tezpur server. So every paper below was read only through its search-result
abstract or snippet. The column "Checked" says what was seen: **A** = abstract or snippet only,
**F** = read from the source itself (the FineWeb-2 and AI4Bharat repository files, and the
IIIT-Indic-HW-UC paper, whose author PDF the owner supplied),
**M** = from memory, not searched in this session. Nothing marked A or M may be cited before it
has been checked against the full text (CLAUDE.md rule).

## 1. Findings in brief

1. **No end-to-end recogniser for handwritten Meitei Mayek words or lines was found.** The
   nearest work segments handwritten pages into lines and words but recognises only isolated
   characters (Inunganbi et al., 2020), or corrects a character classifier's output on segmented
   words with zones and the orthographic rule (Hijam and Saharia, 2024; Hijam's thesis adds a
   character LSTM language model).
2. **The one risk to the novelty claim is resolved.** IIIT Hyderabad's camera-captured
   handwritten dataset, IIIT-Indic-HW-UC (Mondal and Jawahar), includes Manipuri, but in
   **Bengali script**: the script column of its Table 1 says so, and its Manipuri word samples
   (Fig. 3) are Bengali-script handwriting (F). 101 writers, 200K words, 75,531 distinct words;
   CRNN baseline at 90.99% CRR and 83.38% WRR. There is no Meitei Mayek in it, so the novelty
   statement holds (section 7).
3. Meitei Mayek text recognition exists only for **print** (NE-OCR, 2026 preprint; a
   printed-character benchmark from 2022) and for isolated **scene-text characters**. EMBiL (2023)
   detects Meitei Mayek scene text and identifies its language but does not read it. IIIT
   Hyderabad's printed OCR (Mozhi) covers Manipuri, script not yet checked; the same group writes
   Manipuri in Bengali script in IIIT-Indic-HW-UC.
4. **No handwriting generation model for Meitei Mayek was found.** Indic diffusion work covers
   isolated Bangla characters and an unpublished Devanagari repository.
5. **Native Unicode Meitei Mayek text is scarce.** Wikipedia and FineWeb-2 together hold about
   1.45 million running words and 78,000 distinct words, with much overlap (section 10); FineWeb-2
   has 2.69M words of Manipuri in Bengali script (F). The MADLAD-400 authors report that most
   Meitei Mayek text on the web uses non-Unicode fonts (A).
6. **TUMMHCD carries no writer information, and its images carry no size or position**
   (section 10). File names are a class number and a running index; neighbouring and
   same-numbered files are unrelated in style; the characters are scaled to fill a 24 × 24
   frame. 468 groups of pixel-identical images span train and test.
7. **Typed text breaks the ꯢ/ꯏ rule.** Web text uses ꯢ almost only after a vowel, as the rule
   says, but writes 71–90% of the i's after a vowel as ꯏ, so the rule holds for only 28–45% of
   occurrences. The positions agree with the thesis; the spelling does not. Typed corpora cannot
   teach or test this pair as they stand (section 10).

**What IIIT-Indic-HW-UC tells us (F).**
(i) Its split is 75/10/15% of the word images of each language. Each writer wrote 100 to 200
paragraphs and the same paragraph could be written by several writers; the paper does not say
that the split is writer-disjoint or text-disjoint. Our real test set should be both, and say
so: a concrete difference in protocol.
(ii) Its collection protocol (typed prompts copied by hand on A4, photographed with a phone,
page-level boxes and reading order) is a tested template for Phase 3. Phone capture would also
keep our set closer to real use than flatbed scans.
(iii) Its baseline, the CRNN with CTC of Gongidi et al. (iiit-indic-hw-words), is the standard
Indic HTR baseline. Re-implement it on our data as a Phase 2 baseline next to the
pretrained-backbone model.
(iv) The paper states no licence; check the dataset page before any use. Its Bengali-script
Manipuri words could at most serve as same-language pretraining for the visual encoder, a
low-priority experiment.

## 5. Synthetic words and handwriting generation

**Composing words from character images.** Early handwriting synthesis concatenated character
glyphs: sample glyphs, deform them, align them on a baseline, join where needed. The review in
arXiv 2412.15853 ("Semi-supervised adaptation of diffusion models for handwritten text
generation") describes this line of work (A); the primary references (Arabic concatenation work
among them) still have to be collected. Roy, Mohta and Chaudhuri, "Synthetic data generation for
Indic handwritten text recognition", arXiv 1804.06254 (2018), deform digital text for Devanagari
and Bangla words (A). "Self-training of handwritten word recognition for synthetic-to-real
adaptation", arXiv 2206.03149 (A), is the reference point for closing the
synthetic-to-real gap. **No composition of Meitei Mayek words from isolated characters was
found**, and no work that places vowel signs and lonsum finals by zone.

**Generative models (Latin script mostly).** GAN and Transformer era: GANwriting (Kang et al.,
ECCV 2020), ScrabbleGAN (Fogel et al., CVPR 2020), Handwriting Transformers (Bhunia et al.,
ICCV 2021), VATr (Pippi et al., CVPR 2023) (all M). Diffusion: WordStylist (ICDAR 2023,
arXiv 2303.16576), DiffusionPen (ECCV 2024, arXiv 2409.06065; 5 style samples), One-DM
(ECCV 2024, arXiv 2409.04004; one style sample), DiffBrush (Dai et al., ICCV 2025,
arXiv 2508.03256; text lines), WriteViT (arXiv 2505.13235) (A). Evaluation metric to consider:
HWD (Pippi et al., BMVC 2023) (M).

**Indic scripts.** Okkhor-Diffusion, class-guided DDPM for isolated Bangla characters (IEEE
journal, 2024, document 10445466) (A); confidence-guided diffusion augmentation for Bangla
compound characters, arXiv 2605.10916 (2026) (A); a DiffBrush-style latent diffusion model for
Devanagari in a writer's style, GitHub `keysun8/Diffusion_HW_Hindi`, unpublished (A); DCGAN for
Devanagari handwriting (Springer chapter, doi 10.1007/978-981-95-0629-3_7) (A); BengaliDiff,
few-shot Bengali *font* generation (Springer chapter, doi 10.1007/978-3-032-09371-4_7) (A). One search summary said ScrabbleGAN has
been used to synthesise words for 10 Indic languages; source not identified (to check).
**Nothing for Meitei Mayek.**

## 6. Search gaps

Not yet searched: Google Scholar and Shodhganga for Indian theses on Meitei Mayek word or text
recognition since 2020 (Manipur University, NIT Manipur, IIIT Manipur); Bhashini's OCR services
(IIIT Hyderabad's Manipuri handwriting data is in Bengali script; is there any model for
Meitei Mayek?); the Hijam thesis itself; Indian conference
proceedings (NCVPRIPG, ICVGIP) for Meitei Mayek word recognition. Worth a second pass from a
machine with open internet.

## 7. Novelty statement (draft)

> To our knowledge, no published work recognises handwritten Meitei Mayek words or lines end to
> end. Earlier work classifies isolated characters, segments handwritten pages into lines and
> words without recognising them (Inunganbi et al., 2020), or corrects a character classifier's
> output on segmented words with zone information and the orthographic rule (Hijam and Saharia,
> 2024, on 100 words; Hijam's thesis adds a character LSTM language model). The only large
> handwritten Manipuri word dataset, IIIT-Indic-HW-UC (Mondal and Jawahar, 2024), is in Bengali
> script. Meitei Mayek text recognition exists only for print (scene-text work classifies
> isolated characters), and no handwriting generation model exists for the script. We contribute
> (1) the first segmentation-free handwritten Meitei Mayek word recogniser, built on pretrained
> visual encoders with a CTC or attention head and a character language model; (2) zone-aware
> synthetic word images composed from TUMMHCD characters at scale; (3) a public, consented,
> writer-disjoint set of real handwritten words from 50 or more writers, with a fixed protocol
> (CER, WER, ꯢ/ꯏ accuracy); (4) a controlled measurement of how much word context resolves ꯢ
> versus ꯏ, which isolated-character models cannot separate (68.2% against a 67.1% majority
> baseline); and later (5) the first diffusion model for Meitei Mayek handwriting, judged by
> whether it improves recognition of real handwriting.

**Distinct from Hijam's thesis:** public benchmark and protocol instead of a private word set;
segmentation-free sequence model instead of per-character CNN plus LSTM correction; synthetic
words at scale; writer-disjoint real test set; the ꯢ/ꯏ question measured directly.

**IIIT Hyderabad check: done (24 September 2026).** Its Manipuri handwriting is in Bengali
script (IIIT-Indic-HW-UC, Table 1 and Fig. 3), so the statement holds as written.

**Recommendations.**

1. *Evaluate on native text only.* Train and evaluate the language model, and measure ꯢ/ꯏ
   statistics, on native Meitei Mayek: Wikipedia, FineWeb-2, FLORES+, IN22 (if Meitei script),
   the printed dataset's transcriptions, and ILCI-II if TDIL's terms allow it. Deduplicate
   across sources (FineWeb-2 contains Wikipedia pages).
2. *Transliterated text is training data only, and flagged.* Bengali-script Manipuri is about 44
   times larger in FineWeb-2, but a transliterator decides ꯢ versus ꯏ by its own rules, so transliterated text
   carries the rule in by construction. Never use it to measure the rule or to test the language
   model on this pair; report results with and without it.
3. *Word list for synthetic words* from native text, weighted by frequency, with a held-out set
   of words that never appear in synthetic training data, so the test also measures unseen
   words.
4. *Prompts for the real test set (Phase 3).* Take sentences from a CC BY source (IN22, if its
   Manipuri is Meitei script) so the released set can itself be CC BY; CC BY-SA prompts (FLORES+,
   Wikipedia) would force share-alike. Add designed words that stress ꯢ/ꯏ and the other three
   confusable pairs.
5. *Replicate the rule figure.* `corpus_stats.py` reports how often the rule holds on each
   corpus, over running and distinct words. The thesis figure (94.7% on about 26,000 expert-checked
   words) and the frequency ratio (ꯢ about 3.6 times ꯏ) can be checked on open data this way.

*Revised after the first run (section 10):* native typed text is not reliable for the ꯢ/ꯏ pair,
so recommendation 1 no longer covers ꯢ/ꯏ statistics; those need text with checked spelling.

## 9. TUMMHCD writer information

**Outcome of the first run: no writer information (section 10).**

**What was known before.** 85,124 images, 55 classes, 72,330 train and 12,794 test (the first paper). About
500 writers, collected in two phases: unconstrained writing (answer sheets, classroom notes) and
tabular forms (dataset paper abstract, A). The archive holds `TUMMHCDtrain/train_NNN` and
`TUMMHCDtest/test_NNN` folders (`mayek/split.py` in the first project). Images are small scans,
mostly 24 × 24 px with strokes two to three pixels wide (`mayek/preprocess.py`): composed words
will be low resolution, and composition should work at that scale and upsample afterwards.

**What is not known.** Whether writer identity survives anywhere in the release, and whether the
official train/test split is writer-disjoint.

**What the audit measures** (`scripts/audit_tummhcd.py`, run from the notebook):

| Output | Reads as a writer signal when |
|---|---|
| `structure.images_in_subfolders_below_class_folder` | above zero: folders below the class level may be writers |
| `names.numbers[*]` | a writer ID has at most a few hundred values (about 500 writers), may repeat within a class, and recurs across classes; a running index fills its range per class (`median_fill_of_range_per_class` near 1), never repeats within a class, and its maximum is close to the class size |
| `other_files` | any list, spreadsheet or read-me that maps files to writers |
| `style.orders.{name,archive,time}.lag_k.mean` | clearly above the random-order value (which sits within about ±0.01 of zero at this size) at lag 1 and falling with the lag: files were saved writer by writer. The lag where it reaches the random level is roughly how many consecutive files one writer contributed |
| `style.same_number_across_classes` | above the shuffled value: the same number in different classes is the same writer (one tabular form per writer) |
| `duplicates.groups_spanning_train_and_test` | above zero: identical images in train and test (leakage; also relevant to the first paper) |

The style features (scan height and width, ink fraction, paper and ink grey levels, stroke width,
the four margins) are z-scored within each class, so character shape does not count as style.
On independent images the correlations sit at zero; on synthetic data with writer blocks or
tabular forms they are clearly positive (`tests/test_audit_tummhcd.py`).

**What each outcome means for Phase 1.**

- *Explicit writer IDs* (folders, names, a side file): compose writer-consistent words directly;
  split writers into train/validation/test for synthetic data.
- *Hidden grouping only:* cut each class's file sequence into pseudo-writer blocks where the
  style changes; link blocks across classes only if the same-number test is positive. Writer
  consistency is then approximate, and the paper must say so.
- *Nothing:* compose words from style-matched characters (nearest neighbours in size, stroke
  width and ink level) and normalise scale and stroke width. Writer-disjoint evaluation then comes
  from the Phase 3 real test set only, which is writer-disjoint from TUMMHCD by construction.
  Also ask Hijam and Saharia whether writer IDs exist for the form-based part.

## 10. Results of the first Colab run (24 September 2026)

Files: `results/tummhcd_audit.json` (all 85,124 images; archive sha256 7637cb9e…) and
`results/corpus_stats.json`. Every number below comes from them. The breakdowns added afterwards
(image sizes per class, the labels of duplicates, what precedes ꯢ and ꯏ) need a second run.

### TUMMHCD: no writer information

| Where we looked | What we found |
|---|---|
| Folders and side files | no folder below the class folders, no other files; all 85,124 files are `.tif` |
| File names | one template, `mmhc<k>_<n>`. k runs 1–55 and is the class number plus one (each value sits in one class, in its train and test folders); n runs from 1 to the class size, fills that range and never repeats within a class: a running index, not a writer |
| Same n in different classes | style correlation 0.002 over 83,110 pairs, against 0.000 shuffled: the n-th files of two classes are not linked, so no tabular-form grouping survives |
| Neighbours in name order | 0.012 at lag 1 and 0.003 at lag 10, against −0.003 in random order: files were not saved writer by writer |
| Neighbours in file-time order | 0.064 at lag 1, falling slowly (0.025 at lag 100), carried by paper grey level (0.21) and ink grey level (0.11) more than by stroke width (0.06): scan batches, not writers. 682 distinct file times from 23 July to 19 September 2018, a median of 12 per class: each class was written out in about a dozen batches |

**The images carry no size or position.** Height and width never vary within a class, and the
5th and 95th percentiles over all images are both 24 px. Each margin between the ink and the
frame is at most one pixel in at least 95% of the images, and zero at the top and left. So the
characters were cropped to their ink and scaled to fill a 24 × 24 frame: its original size, aspect ratio and place in the word are gone. The second run
lists any class stored at another fixed size.

**Duplicates.** 1,741 groups of pixel-identical images hold 3,512 images; 468 of the groups span
train and test. How many groups carry different labels, and how many test images have an
identical train image, needs the second run: the first run's `groups_spanning_classes` (479)
counted the train and test folders of one class as two classes, so it is not a count of label
conflicts.

**What this means.**

- Phase 1 cannot take a word's characters from one writer, and synthetic data cannot be split by
  writer. Compose words from characters matched in style (stroke width, ink and paper grey level;
  file-time batches as a weak session grouping). Keep TUMMHCD's own train/test split for the
  characters of synthetic training and test words, and take writer-disjoint evaluation from the
  Phase 3 real set only.
- Zone-aware placement needs a size and position model per class, because the images have none.
  One handle is the stroke width in the 24-px frame: for the same pen, a small glyph scaled up to
  fill the frame gets thicker strokes, so the median stroke width per class estimates each
  class's relative size. Check this in Phase 1.
- For the first paper (under review), two checks. If it explains the gain from the size features
  by glyph size or zone, compare that with the above: image height and width are constant within
  classes and the ink fills the frame, so those features can carry little beyond ink fraction
  (or a class-specific frame size, if the second run finds one). And test images with an
  identical train image can flatter every TUMMHCD result, the published ones included; once the
  second run counts them, report accuracy with and without them.

### Corpora: sizes

| Source | Running words | Distinct words | Non-space characters in the Meitei block |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Meitei Wikipedia dump | 1,036,283 | 72,437 | 19.5% (markup, English templates) |
| FineWeb-2 `mni_Mtei` | 52,395 | 11,141 | 91.1% |
| FineWeb-2 `mni_Mtei_removed` | 365,832 | 33,425 | 70.7% |
| All three (they overlap) | 1,454,510 | 77,580 | 25.0% |

FLORES+ did not download (gated: it needs `HF_TOKEN` after accepting its terms). Words here are
runs of Meitei Mayek letters, which is why FineWeb-2 counts fewer than its own 61,256. The removed
part seems to hold much Wikipedia interface text (ꯋꯤꯀꯤꯄꯦꯗꯤꯌꯥ, "Wikipedia", is among its 15 most
frequent words). Deduplicate before any use.

### ꯢ and ꯏ in typed text

| | Wikipedia | FineWeb-2 | FineWeb-2 removed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ꯢ, all occurrences | 30,756 | 517 | 9,719 |
| ꯏ, all occurrences | 108,124 | 6,120 | 48,515 |
| ꯢ outside a vowel context | 0.42% | 1.9% | 0.7% |
| ꯏ among the i's after a vowel | 71.2% | 90.4% | 80.2% |
| i's after a vowel per other i | 3.29 | 3.98 | 5.15 |
| rule holds (running words) | 45.3% | 27.6% | 32.7% |

"After a vowel" means after a consonant letter (with its inherent a), a vowel letter or a vowel
sign; everything else is word start, a lonsum final, nung or apun.

Typed text uses ꯢ almost only after a vowel, as the rule says, but writes most i's after a vowel
as ꯏ. So the rule holds for only 28–45% of occurrences, and in Wikipedia ꯏ is 3.5 times as
frequent as ꯢ, the reverse of the thesis figure (ꯢ about 3.6 times ꯏ). The positions agree with
the thesis: Wikipedia has 3.3 i's after a vowel for every other i, close to its 3.6. The simplest
reading is that typists write ꯏ where the thesis's corpus (and presumably TUMMHCD's labels) have
ꯢ: a difference of spelling practice, not of language. The second run counts both letters by the
preceding character, which checks this context by context, including after consonant letters,
where our reading of "after a vowel" (the inherent a) could differ from the thesis's.

**What this means.**

- Typed corpora cannot teach or test the ꯢ/ꯏ distinction as they stand: a language model trained
  on them would prefer ꯏ after vowels, against the thesis orthography.
- The project needs a transcription convention, fixed and written down before Phase 1. Standard
  orthography as in the thesis (ꯢ after a vowel) is the natural choice if TUMMHCD's labels follow
  it: check with a language expert, and check what the TUMMHCD paper says about labelling 044
  and 025.
- Under that convention, normalise typed text before training (ꯏ after a vowel becomes ꯢ). This
  also erases the genuine exceptions (5.3% of the thesis's checked words), so what context adds
  beyond the rule can only be measured on text with checked spelling: the thesis's TDIL corpus,
  ILCI-II, the printed dataset's transcriptions, or our own test-set transcriptions made under the
  convention.

## 11. To do

1. Rerun `notebooks/phase0_data_audit.ipynb`: it now takes the scripts from the working branch
   and adds image sizes per class, the labels of duplicate groups, the test images with an
   identical train image (listed in `results/tummhcd_audit_duplicates.csv`), and ꯢ/ꯏ counts by
   preceding character. Commit the new result files.
2. Fix the ꯢ/ꯏ transcription convention with a language expert; find out how TUMMHCD labelled
   044 and 025.
3. First paper: check the size-feature explanation, and score the test set without the images
   that have an identical train image (after item 1).
4. Get text with checked spelling: ILCI-II (register on TDIL-DC), the printed dataset's text files
   (Mendeley Data); FLORES+ with `HF_TOKEN`. Check the Manipuri script and size in IN22, BPCC and
   Sangraha.
5. IIIT Hyderabad: the licence on the IIIT-Indic-HW-UC page, and the script of Manipuri in Mozhi.
6. Read the full texts of the entries marked A that we will cite, starting with Inunganbi et al.
   (2020): is the MM page dataset available? Read Hijam's thesis chapter on the CNN + LSTM word
   model (test set, size, results).
7. TUMMHCD paper: is the official test split meant to be writer-disjoint? Pixel-identical images in
   both halves show that at least some images, and so some writers, are shared.
